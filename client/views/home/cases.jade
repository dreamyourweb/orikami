          p In co-creation with KplusV we developed a web application, which maps the vitality of a cultural organisation. By means of a questionnaire we measure innovativity, distinctiveness, strategy and business execution. When the questionnaire is finished, the application presents a diagnosis.
          h3 insight
          p The diagnosis is presented in an interactive data visualization. This way the user can learn about the different aspects of his/her organisation.
          h3 intelligence
          p Together with the experts of KplusV we made a mathematical model of the available knowledge about cultural entrepreneurship. While the aforementioned diagnosis is loosely based on this model we took it one step further and incorporated an organisation specific advise for action. The advise focuses on how this specific organisation should act to become more entrepreneurial and adapt to modern times with their unique challenges.

          p Together with the Center for Higher Educational Policy Studies, an institute linked to University Twente, we developed a web application that maps universities on 29 dimensions. The data application we developed lets you search, filter and compare universities on all of these dimensions. Furthermore, the back-end is fully equiped for gathering standardized information about higher educational institutions in countries with differ-ent traditions and ways of presenting their data. The U-map application validates data input thoroughly.
          h3 insight
          p The multidimensional classification is presented in an interactive and simple way.
          h3 intelligence
          p There is a lot of information In the 29 dimensional data of all universities. This data encloses connections between uni-versities never seen before. We devel-oped a simple but efficient algorithm to discover and compare universities based on similarity.

          h3 data product
          p Mozart is being developed in deep collaboration with market research company DVJ insights. On one side we directly listen to open sources like Twitter, Facebook and Last.FM to learn what people are saying. We combine this with specialized information from radio airplay, spotify and youtube. The last piece of information comes from a large user panel. We sample feedback from users about what they like.
          h3 insight
          p We deliver realtime insights to the Top40 about the general sentiment of a song and the average demographics. Who is listening to this song? What’s their age? Where do they live? What do they listen to more? Etc.
          h3 intelligence
          p Intelligence is introduced when we combine all this information to deliver a representative trending list for a certain market segment. Furthermore our algorithms are able to make predictions about what’s going to be hot.

          p The ‘BierApp’ is orikami spin-off and is following a life of its own since july 2014, with orikami as technical partner. The ‘BierApp’ is an advanced cross-platform application available on iOS and Android, with a large database of beers and café’s available through the web. Because of real-time data availability we developed an efficient RESTFULL API that connects to all mobile devices.
          h3 insight
          p Besides relevant information about beers like the brewery, the beertype and the taste. We show realtime insights on which beers are available in cafe’s. Furthermore we show information about which beers you liked and which are on your wishlist.
          h3 intelligence
          p To add some intelligence and help you discover beers we developed two different algorithms. The first one matches characteristics of beers with one another. We show similar beers based on a very diverse set of characteristics. Beer style and substyle are important, as well as taste characteristics. Furthermore we developed a self learning model that learns from experts which beers should match.The second algorithm gives an advice on your personal preference. It is based upon which beers you liked before and makes a relevance match on your personal profile.
