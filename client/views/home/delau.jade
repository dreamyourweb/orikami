        h3 Accurate predictions
        p Our brain is able to recognize patterns from the past and makes predictions for the future based on these patterns. We studied the brain and its powerfull abilities for recognizing patterns and building predictive models. Our data products lift the power of prediction!

        h3 Real-time insight
        p We love old sayings like: "Measuring is knowing" and "knowledge is power". However it gets confusing when "Time is money". That's why we help you to get your insights as quickly as possible. We make data real-time available, through easy to understand interactive data visualizations!

        h3 Self-learning algorithms
        p People learn by giving them feedback. Software can learn too! We use the power of giving our software feedback, so it can learn. We just tell it when it did something right (give it a carrot) and wrong (hit it softly with a stick). Carrot and stick are very helpfull in training our software to do the right thing.

        h2 Orikami is not your run-of-the-mill data science company. We are not statisticians. We are computational neuroscientists. We are artificial intelligence scientists. We are real data scientists.

        h3 Hacking Skills
        p Data is a commodity traded electronically, therefore, we need to speak hacker. Far from 'black hat' activities, data hackers must be able to manipulate text files at the command-line, thinking algorithmically, and be interested in learning new tools.

        h3 Math & Statistics
        p Once we have acquired and cleaned the data, the next step is to actually extract insight from it. We need to apply appropriate math and statistics methods. We are talking about both classical statistics and machine learning or pattern recognition. 

        h3 Domain Expertise
        p Science is about discovery and building knowledge, which requires motivating questions about the world and hypotheses that can be brought to data and tested with statistical methods. Relevant questions first, then data.
